  Biodiversity risk is an emerging challenge for firms and a growing concern for investors. We evaluate how companies disclose biodiversity risk exposure in their 10-K filings and how these disclosures shape investor perceptions. Using a two-step approach that combines natural language processing and large language models, we identify and classify voluntary disclosure of exposure to biodiversity risk as either direct (explicit acknowledgments of exposure) or indirect (implied exposure embedded in business discussions). We find that firms are more likely to disclose biodiversity risk exposure, particularly through direct disclosure, when institutional ownership is higher and when local stakeholder pressure intensifies. While managers tend to issue direct disclosures in response to information demand, investors react more strongly to indirect disclosures, especially when these disclosures appear for the first time. This divergence underscores a tension in disclosure preferences for exposure to emerging and rapidly evolving risks such as biodiversity: managers prioritize "reliability" and disclose only when confident, whereas investors value "relevance" and respond more strongly to timely, even if less definitive, signals.
