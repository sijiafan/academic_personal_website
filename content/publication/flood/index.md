# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "**Abstract**: Floods are among the costliest natural disasters, yet we know little about what drives business recovery. This gap matters as climate risk rises and government bailouts may become more limited under tightening fiscal budgets. Using establishment-level data that link remote sensing inundation to FEMA flood maps, I provide novel causal evidence that flood insurance is a key driver of business recovery. I combine a triple difference design around Hurricane Sandy with a spatial regression discontinuity at floodplain borders. Flooded establishments just inside floodplains, where properties with federally backed or regulated mortgages must carry flood insurance, recover more in employment and sales than otherwise similar sites just outside. Effects are larger where firms are more likely to be insured and where policy limits can cover more losses. Establishments of firms that disclosed insurance pre-flood also recover more. These patterns reflect an insurance-liquidity channel that supports rebuilding and reallocation, allowing firms to return stronger rather than merely to baseline. In equity markets, price drops around flood news are smaller for firms with prior exposure or disclosure. Overall, the evidence indicates insurance coverage materially shapes business recovery.
