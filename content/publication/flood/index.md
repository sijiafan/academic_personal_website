# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Floods are among the costliest U.S. disasters, yet we know little about how businesses recover. I combine high-resolution remote sensing inundation, FEMA flood maps, and establishment data. Using a triple difference around Hurricane Sandy and a spatial regression discontinuity that compares establishments just inside and outside the FEMA floodplains, I provide novel causal evidence that flooded establishments inside the floodplain (where the NFIP mandatory purchase requirement applies) recover more in employment and sales than comparable peers outside. The recovery is larger where insurance is more likely to be in place and where a larger share of losses can be insured. Federal programs (SBA disaster loans and FEMA Public Assistance) are associated with additional local gains. Firms that disclosed insurance opportunities before the flood also see stronger establishment recovery; stock market reactions to flood news are less negative for firms with prior flood exposure or disclosure. Together, the findings show that mandate-induced insurance access, public aid, and firm preparedness shape real and financial resilience to disaster risk."
