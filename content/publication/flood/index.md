# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Floods are among the costliest disasters, yet we know little about how businesses recover. This matters as climate risk rises and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) faces fiscal pressures. Using establishment-level data that link remote sensing inundation to FEMA flood maps, I show that flood insurance is a key driver of recovery. I combine a triple difference design around Hurricane Sandy with a spatial regression discontinuity at floodplain borders. Flooded establishments just inside mapped floodplains, where properties with federally backed or regulated mortgages must carry flood insurance, recover more in employment and sales than otherwise similar sites just outside. Effects are larger where firms are likelier to be insured and where policy limits can cover more losses. Using parent companiesâ€™ pre-event insurance-opportunity disclosures as a coverage proxy, I find that affiliated establishments recover more after flooding. Federal post-disaster aid is associated with additional local improvements. Overall, the evidence indicates insurance access materially shapes business recovery after floods by providing liquidity that enables capital upgrading and reallocation."
