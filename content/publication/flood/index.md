# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: " I study how floods and chronic flood risk affect U.S. establishments and firms by combining high-resolution remote sensing flood data, FEMA flood maps, and establishment-level data. After floods, I find that establishments show growth in employment and sales, with recovery supported by insurance payouts and federal aid. Using a triple-difference and spatial regression discontinuity design around regulatory boundaries, I provide novel causal evidence that flood insurance plays a critical role in enhancing recovery, particularly for establishments subject to the mandatory National Flood Insurance Program purchase requirement. Federal aid, notably SBA disaster loans, also strengthens recovery by supporting small businesses and generating local spillovers. In contrast, chronic flood risk is associated with persistent declines in employment and business diversity, likely driven by higher insurance expenses and increased business exits. At the firm level, these patterns persist and the dynamics aggregate: firms with greater flood risk disclose these risks more proactively and reduce investment in physical assets, while markets react more negatively to floods for firms lacking prior exposure or disclosure. Overall, my findings highlight how insurance and risk communication enhance resilience to climate shocks, while underscoring the need for policies that mitigate long-term vulnerability without encouraging unsustainable development."
